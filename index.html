      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">A job related to the sports field had always attracted me. Practicing mixed martial arts myself for several years now, this marriage of knowledge and trends was self-evident.
        I then decided to complete my studies in massage therapy as well as orthotherapy. With this academic and practical background, I could have the chance to work with athletes of all levels, relieve and support them in their sporting and professional journey.
      Obviously, since that day, I have continued my professional training, because I love it too much.Obviously, since that day, I have continued my professional training, because I love it too much. I have a passion for it and I see myself doing this until a very old age ... If the body allows me of course!</p>

<h3>Relaxation massage</h3>
<p class="my-skills">Relaxation massage is a smooth, gentle, flowing style that promotes general relaxation, relieves muscular tension, plus improves circulation and range of movement.
This is the style of massage you'll find performed at day spas. Your therapist will aim to relax, revive and rejuvenate you at a massage depth that does not cause discomfort.
Swedish massage is probably the best-known form of relaxation massage.</p>

        <img class="orthotherapy" src="images/orthotherapy.jpg" alt="">
        <h3 class="ortho-therapy">orthotherapy</h3>
        <p class="my-skills">Orthotherapy is a natural therapy that combines massage therapy to kinesitherapy (therapy by movement) and is intended for people who suffers from muscle pain and joints stiffness, which are usually caused by a bad posture or sudden and repetitive movements.
The term orthotherapy comes from the prefix ortho- which means “right” or “correct” and expresses well the idea of this discipline. Indeed, orthotherapy aims at rebalancing the musculoskeletal system by mostly intervening on the muscular system.
Orthotherapy is a relatively recent specialization in Canada since its practice emerged in the 70’s. However, it holds a prominent place in the range of holistic manual techniques.</p>      </div>
